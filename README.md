# About
* The Monty Hall problem is a famous, seemingly paradoxical problem in conditional probability and reasoning using Bayes' theorem. Information affects your decision that at first glance seems as though it shouldn't.

* In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose between three doors. Behind each door, there is either a ✔️ or a ❌. You choose a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which he knows has a ❌ behind it, and opens it, showing you the ❌. (You know, by the rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a ❌.) Monty then asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to the other remaining door. Assuming you prefer having a ✔️ more than having a ❌, do you choose to switch or not to switch?

* The solution is that switching will let you win twice as often as sticking with the original choice, a result that seems counterintuitive to many. The Monty Hall problem famously embarrassed a large number of mathematicians with doctorate degrees when they attempted to "correct" Marilyn vos Savant's solution in a column in Parade Magazine.

### Why?
* I wanted to test my JavaScript knowledge without watching yt tutorials and with as little internet searching as possible. Thus, this took 6 to 8 hours until this commit.


### Future Improvements
1) Styling and responsiveness.
2) Some kind of gudinace for the player because average player wouldn't know what to do.
3) Description inside the game and maybe a link to yt video.
